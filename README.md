# Splunk-SOC-Detection-Project

In this project, I performed the role of a SOC Analyst, simulating real-world attacks, detecting them using Splunk, Suricata, and Sysmon, and building automated response workflows.
The project covers host-level attacks, network-level intrusions, phishing analysis, and custom Splunk detection rules, along with playbooks for automated response.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

**ðŸ“˜Attack_Simulations_Docs/** â†’ Performed host-level attacks (failed logins, brute force, privilege escalation, persistence, etc.) and documented their detection with screenshots and detailed proof-of-concepts.

**ðŸ“˜Network_level_Attacks/** â†’ Using Suricata, Wireshark, and Kali Linux (DVWA web app), I executed and detected network-level attacks in Splunk with proper POC screenshots and documentation.

**ðŸ“˜Phishing_Analysis/** â†’ Conducted phishing investigations (header, body, links, attachments) and wrote a few automation scripts to speed up phishing analysis tasks.

**ðŸ“˜Splunk_Rules/** â†’ Developed custom SPL rules and correlation searches to reduce investigation time, mapped them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for better threat coverage.

**ðŸ“˜Study_material/** â†’ Notes, references, and research material I used throughout the project â€” helpful for SOC analyst learning and continuous improvement.

**Active_Directory/** â†’ Basic understanding and setup notes for Windows AD; no project yet, but kept for future extension if time permits.
