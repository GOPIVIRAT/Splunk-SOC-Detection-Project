# 📌 Title: Suspicious File Creation in Sensitive Directories
# 📝 Description: Detects creation of potentially malicious scripts or binaries (.ps1, .exe, .dll, .vbs, .js) in suspicious directories like Temp, AppData, and ProgramData. Helps detect malware drops or staging.

# 🧾 Explanation:

#### 🛠️ How it Works:
- Looks for **Sysmon Event ID 11** (file creation)
- Filters files written in **Temp, AppData, ProgramData** directories
- Flags files with **risky extensions** like `.exe`, `.ps1`, `.dll`, `.js`, `.vbs`
- These directories are often used to drop or hide **malicious payloads**

#### ✅ Why It’s Useful:
- Detects early stages of malware infection (file dropped but not yet run)
- Helps identify tools/scripts that **bypass AV** and hide in user folders
- Works well as an **early detection alert**

#### 👨‍💻 Analyst Tip:
- Cross-reference `Image` field to find the process that created the file
- Combine with **Process Creation (Event ID 1)** to trace attack chain
- Add filters for **file size or known safe processes** to reduce false alerts
