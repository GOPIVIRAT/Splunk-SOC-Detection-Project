# 📌 Title: Persistence via Startup Folder File Drop – Executable or Script Detected
# 📝 Description: Detects executable or script files (.exe, .bat, .ps1, .vbs) written to the Windows Startup folder. This is a common persistence technique that ensures the dropped file executes at every user login.
# 🧠 MITRE ATT&CK Technique:
- T1547.001 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Startup Folder

| eval file_path=lower(TargetFilename), file_name=mvindex(split(file_path, "\\"), -1)

# 🧾 Explanation:

#### 🛠️ How it Works:
- Uses **Sysmon Event ID 11** to detect file creation
- Filters for paths targeting the **Startup folder**
- Matches files with **risky extensions** like `.exe`, `.ps1`, `.bat`, and `.vbs`
- These files will auto-run when a user logs in, establishing persistence

#### ✅ Why It’s Useful:
- Easy to detect early-stage persistence by malware, RATs, or pentesters
- Attackers love this technique because it requires **no elevated privileges**
- Common in phishing payloads and USB-based attacks

#### 👨‍💻 Analyst Tip:
- Cross-reference the process that dropped the file (check `Image` field)
- Combine with file hash, VT check, or rare parent processes to reduce false positives
