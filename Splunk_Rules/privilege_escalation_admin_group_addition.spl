# 🧾 Explanation:

#### 🛠️ How it Works:
- Searches for **EventCode 4732**, which logs when a user is added to a security group
- Filters for `Group_Name="Administrators"` only (ignores other groups like "Users")
- Extracts:
  - `Target_User`: who got admin rights
  - `Admin_Adder`: who performed the action
  - `Time`: when it happened
- Sorted by latest events for quick alert visibility

#### ✅ Why it's Better:
- Filters out noise from irrelevant group additions
- Ensures field extraction is reliable (`coalesce` handles missing values)
- Makes alert email or dashboard easy to read by SOC analyst

#### 👨‍💻 Analyst Tip:
- If this happens during off-hours or by unexpected users (e.g., non-IT), it should trigger **immediate investigation**
- Consider alerting **only outside business hours** using cron in the alert settings
