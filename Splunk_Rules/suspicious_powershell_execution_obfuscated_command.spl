# 📌 Title: Suspicious PowerShell Execution with Obfuscation or Network Access
# 📝 Description: Detects PowerShell execution using suspicious flags or obfuscation techniques like 'EncodedCommand', 'IEX', 'Bypass', or usage of WebClient. These are common in malware, phishing payloads, or in-memory attacks.
# 🧠 MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:
- T1059.001 – PowerShell  
- T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information  
- T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer

# 🧾 Explanation:

#### 🛠️ How it Works:
- Looks for **PowerShell executions** (Sysmon Event ID 1).
- Converts the command line to lowercase for easier matching.
- Flags PowerShell scripts that use:
  - `encodedCommand` → base64 encoded payloads
  - `iex` → dynamically runs code (used in malware)
  - `bypass` → ignores execution policies
  - `webclient` → downloads from internet
- Uses `eval match_type` to label the technique being used.

#### ✅ Why It’s Useful:
- Detects **obfuscated or hidden PowerShell usage**, often seen in:
  - Phishing attacks
  - Malware dropper scripts
  - Fileless or in-memory attacks
- Prevents attackers from abusing PowerShell stealthily.

#### 👨‍💻 Analyst Tip:
- Combine this with:
  - File drops in suspicious paths (Event ID 11)
  - Network connections (Event ID 3)
  - Unusual parent processes (like `winword.exe`, `excel.exe`)
- This rule is **great for early detection of malicious scripting tools** used in post-exploitation.
