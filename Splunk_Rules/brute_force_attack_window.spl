# 📌 Title: Brute Force Detection – Multiple Failed Logins in Short Time Window
# 📝 Description: Detects brute-force login attempts by identifying 5 or more failed login events (EventCode 4625) for a single account within a short time frame (2 minutes).

# 🧾 Explanation:

#### 🛠️ How it Works:
- Looks for **EventCode 4625**: Failed login
- Groups by **Account_Name** to count login attempts per user
- Uses `earliest(_time)` and `latest(_time)` to calculate time range
- Triggers alert if 5+ failures happen within **120 seconds (2 minutes)**

#### ✅ Why it's Better:
- Avoids false positives from users who forget passwords throughout the day
- Focuses on aggressive behavior often seen in automated brute-force tools

#### 👨‍💻 Analyst Tip:
You can adjust the time window or count (`>= 5`) depending on how strict your detection needs to be in your organization.
