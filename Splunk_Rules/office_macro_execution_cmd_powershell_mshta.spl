# 📌 Title: Office Macro Execution via PowerShell, CMD, WScript, or Mshta
# 📝 Description: Detects suspicious child processes (PowerShell, CMD, WScript, Mshta) spawned by Microsoft Office apps like Word or Excel. This behavior is commonly associated with macro-based attacks and phishing payloads.
# 🧠 MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:
- T1203 – Exploitation for Client Execution  
- T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  
- T1566.001 – Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment  
- T1133 – External Remote Services (via mshta or script execution)

# 🧾 Explanation:

#### 🛠️ How it Works:
- Looks for Office apps (`winword.exe`, `excel.exe`) launching suspicious child processes
- Common payload droppers: `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `mshta.exe`, `wscript.exe`
- These are often launched by **malicious macros** embedded in `.doc` or `.xls` attachments

#### ✅ Why It’s Useful:
- Detects **macro-based execution chains** (used in Emotet, QBot, Dridex, etc.)
- Helps stop initial access via phishing attachments
- Gives visibility into Office process behavior — especially **LOLBins** abuse

#### 👨‍💻 Analyst Tip:
- Combine with file creation (`Event ID 11`) or network connection (`Event ID 3`) to confirm malicious activity
- Watch for unknown `User` values or uncommon Office behavior during off-hours
